Blendgit is an addon for Blender 2.6 <http://www.blender.org/> that
lets you keep track of multiple versions of a .blend file using the Git
<http://git-scm.com/> version-control system. Blender itself lets you
keep older versions of a file each time you save, up to a maximum of 32;
using version control extends this to unlimited versions, and also lets you
attach a comment to each one to remind yourself why it was saved.

Once you have installed the addon and enabled it for the current document,
you will see an extra submenu at the bottom of your “File” menu, entitled
“Version Control”:  this contains two items, “Load Version...” and “Save Version...”.
